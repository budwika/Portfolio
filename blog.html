                <h2>#NewMusicTuesday: Maroon 5, Red Pill Blues</h2><!--header of the blog post-->
                <!--apply text effect to the paragraph-->
                <p id="texteffect">Sorry to break it to you, Maroon 5 diehards, but Red Pill Blues sounds nothing like classic Maroon 5. But don't worry - Adam Levine's sexy voice and the 
                    band's clean, melodic artistry are ever-present, and now with the welcome addition of electro beats.</p>
                   <p> ICYMI, Red Pill Blues is a reference to The Matrix, but Levine is hesitant about assigning a specific meaning to the name of the album - he wants 
                    fans to decide what it means to them. And speaking of fans, the lead singer says he's not worried about disappointing a few along the way with a new 
                    sound. It's all about evolution, and not getting stuck in a rut. You could never disappoint us, Adam! </p>
                    
                   <p> To bring a fresher feel to the record, Maroon 5 collaborated with a mix of artists, including Kendrick Lamar, Future, LunchMoney Lewis and Julia 
                    Michaels, who added a feminine touch to "Help Me Out."" The band's sixth studio album, Red Pill Blues debuted at No. 2 on the Billboard 200 when it was 
                    released on <time datetime ="2017-11-03">November 3</time>. Just days before that, Maroon 5 announced its North American tour, which will take place from May to October next year. We are 
                    so ready! </p>
